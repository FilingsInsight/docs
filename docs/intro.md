# Filings Insight 

Let's discover **Filings Insight(x-file.ai) in less than 5 minutes**.

## Intro

**[x-file.ai](https://x-file.ai)** - Filings Insight is an AI-powered platform that collects and analyzes filings data from global financial authorities in real time to deliver business insights. As AI technology advances rapidly, we focus on "what to feed AI"â€”dedicating our efforts to refining and processing vast financial data to provide the highest possible value.

## Problem Definition

- Financial filings are publicly available information, but they are difficult to access and not easily utilized.

- Filings consist of vast amounts of unstructured data, requiring significant time and cost to analyze.

- Language barriers and differences in regulations across countries make it challenging to effectively use global filings data.

- Traditional financial analysis methods often rely on manual processes, lacking automation and real-time analysis.

## What we provide

## The Need for AI and RAG

### Why is AI important?

- Enables rapid extraction and analysis of key information from massive volumes of financial data.

- Provides automation and real-time analysis capabilities, surpassing traditional manual methods.

- Overcomes language barriers and regulatory differences across countries to effectively leverage global filings data.

### Why Content-Centric RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) matters

- Traditional LLM-based search is optimized for general information retrieval, but has limitations in business document analysis.
